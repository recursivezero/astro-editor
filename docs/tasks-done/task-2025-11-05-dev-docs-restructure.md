# Developer Documentation Restructure

## Goal

Restructure developer documentation to combine Tauri Template's clear organization with Astro Editor's rich implementation details. Focus on progressive disclosure, clear naming, and right-sized docs for AI agents and human developers.

## Reference Materials

**Tauri Template Repository**: <https://github.com/dannysmith/tauri-template>

**Key Template Files to Reference**:

- `docs/developer/bundle-optimization.md` - For creating optimization.md
- `docs/developer/state-management.md` - For structure/organization inspiration
- `docs/developer/command-system.md` - For structure/organization inspiration

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT simply copy template content without editing it to ensure it matches Astro Editor's ACTUAL implementation. Much will be similar.

## Actions Required

### Phase 1: Add New Files (4 files)

#### 1.1 Create `docs/developer/state-management.md`

**Extract from**: `architecture-guide.md` (State Management section, lines ~40-140)

**Reference Template**: <https://github.com/dannysmith/tauri-template/blob/main/docs/developer/state-management.md> (for structure)

**Content to Extract** (~200-250 lines):

- The "Onion" pattern (TanStack Query → Zustand → useState) - CRITICAL PATTERN
- Decision tree for state placement (when to use each layer)
- Why decomposed stores? (editor/project/ui) - our specific architecture
- Server state (TanStack Query) patterns
    - Query keys factory pattern
    - Automatic cache invalidation
    - Our specific queries (collections, files, content)
- Client state (Zustand) patterns
    - Store decomposition strategy
    - Why three stores not one?
    - getState() pattern for stable references - CRITICAL
- Local state (useState) patterns
    - When to use
    - Common pitfalls
- Integration patterns between layers
    - Bridge pattern (store → query via events)
    - How stores and queries interact
- Real examples from editorStore, projectStore, uiStore

**Critical Content to Preserve**:

- All getState() examples and rationale
- The "Onion" metaphor and decision tree
- Bridge pattern explanation (store can't use hooks)
- Performance implications of each layer

**Goal**: Deep dive into fundamental state architecture. Referenced constantly in code reviews, deserves dedicated doc.

#### 1.2 Create `docs/developer/command-system.md`

**Extract from**: `architecture-guide.md` (Command Pattern section, lines ~200-280)

**Reference Template**: <https://github.com/dannysmith/tauri-template/blob/main/docs/developer/command-system.md> (for structure)

**Content to Extract** (~150-200 lines):

- Command pattern overview - what and why
- Command registry architecture (globalCommandRegistry)
- Why command pattern? (single source of truth for actions)
    - Used by keyboard shortcuts
    - Used by native menus
    - Used by command palette
    - Decouples UI from logic
- Command structure (id, name, group, execute function)
- Registering commands
    - When to register (app initialization)
    - Where to register (app-commands.ts)
    - Command groups ('file', 'navigation', 'edit', etc.)
- Executing commands
    - From keyboard shortcuts: `globalCommandRegistry.execute('toggleBold')`
    - From menus: via Tauri events
    - From command palette: user selection
    - With parameters: `execute('formatHeading', 1)`
- getState() pattern in commands - CRITICAL
    - Commands need editor state but can't use hooks
    - Example: Save command gets currentFile via getState()
- Integration points
    - keyboard-shortcuts.md (react-hotkeys-hook calls commands)
    - Native menus (Tauri menu emits events → executes commands)
    - Command palette (shows registered commands, executes on select)
- Adding new commands (step-by-step)
- Real examples from editor commands (toggleBold, formatHeading, insertLink)

**Critical Content to Preserve**:

- globalCommandRegistry pattern and rationale
- All integration point explanations
- getState() usage in commands
- Real code examples from our codebase

**Goal**: Explain command pattern and its integrations. Foundation for keyboard/menu/palette systems.

#### 1.3 Create `docs/developer/optimization.md`

**Reference Template**: <https://github.com/dannysmith/tauri-template/blob/main/docs/developer/bundle-optimization.md>

**IMPORTANT**: This is NEW content (not extracted). Use template for as a starting point, but ensure it's reflective to Astro Editor's reality.

**Content to Create** (~150-200 lines):

- **Overview**: Why optimization matters for desktop apps
    - Bundle size affects download size and updates
    - Startup time affects user experience
    - Memory usage affects performance on older machines

- **Current Optimizations**:
    - React optimizations we currently use:
        - Production builds (check package.json scripts)
        - Tree shaking (Vite default)
        - React.memo usage (check codebase for examples)
    - Tauri optimizations:
        - Bundle configuration (check tauri.conf.json)
        - Asset handling strategy
        - Binary size (check current .app or .dmg size)
    - Build optimizations:
        - Production builds
        - Minification
        - Source map strategy

- **Bundle Size Analysis**:
    - How to check current bundle size
        - Command: `pnpm run build` then check dist folder size
        - Tools: rollup-plugin-visualizer or vite-plugin-analyze
    - What to look for:
        - Large dependencies (check package.json)
        - Duplicate code
        - Unused imports
    - How to analyze:
        - Add vite-plugin-visualizer to see bundle composition
        - Use vite build --mode analyze

- **Lazy Loading Strategy** (for future):
    - Component lazy loading with React.lazy
    - Route-based code splitting (if we add routing)
    - When to lazy load vs eager load

- **Future Optimization Opportunities**:
    - Dynamic imports for heavy components (PreferencesDialog, CommandPalette)
    - Asset optimization (compress images, use WebP)
    - Font subsetting (if we add custom fonts)
    - Rust/WASM for computationally intensive tasks
    - Virtual scrolling for very long file lists

- **Performance Budgets** (future):
    - Target bundle sizes
    - Target startup time
    - How to measure

- **Related Documentation**:
    - Reference performance-patterns.md for React performance
    - Reference releases.md for build process

**Goal**: Document current optimization state, provide framework for future optimization work as app grows.

#### 1.4 Create `docs/developer/ui-patterns.md`

**Content Source**: Extract SVG positioning fix from `unified-title-bar.md` (lines 80-102)

**IMPORTANT**: This is a NEW guide that will serve as home for common UI patterns. Start with the SVG fix, but structure it to accommodate future patterns.

**Content to Create** (~100-150 lines initially, will grow over time):

- **Overview**: Purpose of this guide
    - Common UI patterns across the application
    - ShadCN/ui best practices specific to our app
    - Solutions to common rendering/styling issues

- **ShadCN/ui Patterns**:
    - Brief intro to shadcn/ui usage in our app
    - How we customize components
    - Common component patterns we use

- **Icon Button Patterns** (from unified-title-bar.md):
    - SVG positioning fix for disabled buttons
    - Problem: 1-pixel shift when disabled attribute applied
    - Solution: Always apply transform fix
    - Example code showing the pattern
    - Explanation of why it works

- **Future Patterns** (placeholder sections for growth):
    - Form field patterns
    - Dialog patterns
    - Layout patterns
    - Animation patterns

**Critical Content to Preserve** (from unified-title-bar.md lines 80-102):

````markdown
## Icon Button Patterns

### SVG Icon Positioning Fix

**Problem**: SVG icons in disabled buttons experience a 1-pixel shift due to browser rendering differences when the `disabled` attribute is applied. This is a known issue with shadcn/ui buttons.

**Solution**: Always apply the CSS transform fix for ALL icon buttons:

```tsx
<Button
  disabled={someCondition}
  className="size-7 p-0 [&_svg]:transform-gpu [&_svg]:scale-100"
>
  <Save className="size-4" />
</Button>
```

**Explanation**:
- `[&_svg]:transform-gpu` enables hardware acceleration for SVG rendering
- `[&_svg]:scale-100` applies `transform: scale(1)` to stabilize positioning
- Prevents pixel shifts when button's disabled state changes
````

**Goal**: Create dedicated home for UI patterns and shadcn/ui best practices. Provides place to document common solutions as we discover them.

### Phase 2: Rename Files (5 files)

Update file names for clarity and consistency:

1. `performance-guide.md` → `performance-patterns.md`
2. `toast-system.md` → `notifications.md`
3. `testing-guide.md` → `testing.md`
4. `release-process.md` → `releases.md`
5. `image-preview-implementation.md` → `feature-image-preview.md`

**Update all cross-references** in:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/README.md`
- Other developer docs that reference these files
- Root `README.md` if applicable

---

### Phase 3: Remove & Consolidate (1 file)

#### 3.1 Remove `docs/developer/unified-title-bar.md`

**Valuable content to preserve**: SVG icon positioning fix (from lines 80-102)

**Where to move it**: Move to new `ui-patterns.md` guide (see Phase 1.4)

**Why remove this doc**:

- Too component-specific (violates philosophy in docs/README.md)
- Most content is self-evident from component code
- Only unique value is the SVG fix, which fits better as a pattern in architecture guide
- Does not serve as feature implementation example (unlike image-preview)

---

### Phase 4: Update Existing Files

#### 4.1 Update `architecture-guide.md`

**Current size**: 612 lines
**Target size**: ~450-500 lines

**Simplify these sections** (move details to specialized docs, keep essential rules):

1. **State Management section** (lines ~40-140, ~100 lines):
   - **Keep in architecture-guide.md**:
     - What the "Onion" pattern is (brief explanation)
     - When to use each layer (quick decision rules)
     - Basic getState() explanation for callbacks
   - **Move to state-management.md**:
     - Detailed store decomposition rationale
     - Comprehensive getState() examples
     - Deep dive into bridge pattern
     - Integration patterns between layers
     - Real-world examples from all three stores
   - **Add reference at end of simplified section**:

     ```markdown
     For comprehensive coverage including store decomposition strategy,
     bridge pattern details, and extensive examples, see
     [state-management.md](./state-management.md).
     ```

2. **Command Pattern section** (lines ~200-280, ~80 lines):
   - **Keep in architecture-guide.md**:
     - What command pattern is and why we use it
     - Basic command registry usage (one simple example)
     - Quick note on integration with keyboard/menus/palette
   - **Move to command-system.md**:
     - Detailed command structure
     - How to register commands
     - All integration point details
     - Multiple examples
     - Step-by-step guide for adding commands
   - **Add reference at end of simplified section**:

     ```markdown
     For detailed command implementation guide including registration,
     integration with keyboard shortcuts and menus, and examples,
     see [command-system.md](./command-system.md).
     ```

**CRITICAL - Keep these sections** (do NOT remove):

- Overview and Tech Stack
- Directory Boundaries (essential architecture rule)
- Direct Store Pattern (critical for forms)
- Event-Driven Communication patterns
- Bridge Pattern (store → query communication)
- TanStack Query patterns (query keys, cache invalidation) - keep high-level overview even though detailed coverage moves to state-management.md
- Code Extraction Patterns
- Testing patterns (high-level overview, detail in testing.md)
- Best Practices
- Key Files Reference
- All important warnings and gotchas

**Result**: More focused architecture guide that serves as hub with references to specialized topics.

#### 4.2 Update `keyboard-shortcuts.md`

**Changes**:

- Add reference to command-system.md for understanding integration
- Keep all current content (implementation guide)

---

## Important Warnings

### Content Preservation

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT lose any valuable Astro Editor content during this refactor:

- All performance patterns and gotchas
- All Direct Store Pattern examples and rationale
- All getState() usage and explanations
- Bridge pattern for store/query communication
- Command registry implementation details
- All warnings about infinite loops, render cascades, etc.

### What NOT to Copy from Template

- Do NOT copy template code examples (use Astro Editor examples)
- Do NOT copy template-specific content (use for structure only)
- Template is a starter - Astro Editor has real implementation details to preserve

### File Operations

- **ALWAYS use `git mv`** for renames to preserve history
- **NEVER use `rm` + new file** - this loses git history
- Verify renames worked: `git log --follow <new-filename>`

### Verification

- Search comprehensively for old file references before completing
- Ensure SVG positioning fix is preserved in ui-patterns.md
- Test all internal markdown links work
- Verify CLAUDE.md works with new structure
- Run `/check` as final verification

### Future Considerations

- Consider adding menus.md later if command-system.md doesn't cover native menus adequately
- Consider splitting optimization.md if it grows beyond 300 lines
- Keep monitoring docs/README.md philosophy as we learn what works
