# Fix Auto-Save Data Loss Risk

**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocks 1.0.0)
**Effort**: ~0.5-1 day
**Type**: Reliability, data integrity

## Problem

The current auto-save implementation clears and reschedules the timeout on every keystroke. This means if a user types continuously for an extended period (e.g., in flow state), auto-save never fires and changes are not saved to disk.

**Evidence**: `src/store/editorStore.ts:459-477`

```typescript
scheduleAutoSave: () => {
  const store = get()

  // Clear existing timeout
  if (store.autoSaveTimeoutId) {
    clearTimeout(store.autoSaveTimeoutId) // ⚠️ Resets on every keystroke
  }

  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    void store.saveFile(false)
  }, autoSaveDelay * 1000) // 2 seconds

  set({ autoSaveTimeoutId: timeoutId })
}
```

## Risk Scenario

1. User starts writing in flow state
2. Types continuously for 10+ minutes without pausing for >2 seconds
3. Auto-save never fires (timeout keeps getting reset)
4. App crashes, system loses power, or user force-quits
5. **All changes since last manual save are lost**

## Requirements

**Must Have**:

- [ ] Auto-save MUST fire within a maximum time window (e.g., 10 seconds) regardless of continuous typing
- [ ] Current debounced behavior should remain (don't save on every keystroke)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing auto-save UX

**Nice to Have**:

- [ ] Persist dirty state to localStorage as backup

## Implementation Plan

**Approach**: Option A (Force Save After Max Delay) - simplest solution that meets requirements

### Changes Required

**File**: `src/store/editorStore.ts`

1. **Add state field** to `EditorState` interface:

   ```typescript
   lastSaveTimestamp: number | null  // Timestamp of last successful save
   ```

2. **Update initial state**:

   ```typescript
   lastSaveTimestamp: null,
   ```

3. **Modify `scheduleAutoSave()` method**:

   ```typescript
   scheduleAutoSave: () => {
     const store = get()
     const now = Date.now()
     const maxDelay = 10000 // 10 seconds in milliseconds

     // Check if we should force save due to max delay
     if (store.isDirty && store.lastSaveTimestamp) {
       const timeSinceLastSave = now - store.lastSaveTimestamp
       if (timeSinceLastSave >= maxDelay) {
         // Force save immediately, don't debounce
         void store.saveFile(false)
         return
       }
     }

     // Normal debounced behavior (existing code)
     if (store.autoSaveTimeoutId) {
       clearTimeout(store.autoSaveTimeoutId)
     }

     const globalSettings = useProjectStore.getState().globalSettings
     const autoSaveDelay = globalSettings?.general?.autoSaveDelay || 2

     const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
       void store.saveFile(false)
     }, autoSaveDelay * 1000)

     set({ autoSaveTimeoutId: timeoutId })
   },
   ```

4. **Update `saveFile()` method** to set timestamp after successful save:

   ```typescript
   // Add after successful save (after isDirty: false)
   set({ lastSaveTimestamp: Date.now() })
   ```

### How It Works

1. User types → `scheduleAutoSave()` is called
2. Check: Has it been ≥10s since last save?
   - **Yes**: Force save immediately, skip debouncing
   - **No**: Use normal 2s debounce behavior
3. On successful save, record timestamp
4. Repeat

### What This Achieves

- ✅ Saves within 10s max during continuous typing
- ✅ Preserves 2s debounce for normal typing (no save spam)
- ✅ No additional timers or complexity
- ✅ No localStorage or recovery changes needed
- ✅ Works with existing save button and unsaved indicator

### Testing

Manual test: Type continuously for 15 minutes

- Expected: File saves every ~10 seconds
- Verify: Check file modification time or console logs

## Context from Review

From staff engineering review:

> **Issues:**
>
> 1. **Continuous typing prevents save**: If user types for 10 minutes straight (e.g., during flow state), auto-save never fires
> 2. **No save queue**: If save fails, there's no retry mechanism
> 3. **Silent failures**: Failed auto-saves just log; user may not notice until data is lost
> 4. **No dirty state persistence**: If app crashes before auto-save fires, recent changes are lost
>
> **Impact:** **HIGH reliability risk** - potential data loss

## Implementation Notes

Current auto-save config:

- Delay: 2 seconds (defined in `editorStore.ts`) an configurable in preferences.
- Triggered on content/frontmatter changes
- Failures logged to console

Key files:

- `src/store/editorStore.ts` - `scheduleAutoSave()` function
- `src/store/editorStore.ts` - `saveFile()` function
- Auto-save scheduled from: `setEditorContent()`, `updateFrontmatterField()`, etc.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can type continuously for 15+ minutes and auto-save still fires within max delay
- [ ] Debounced behavior preserved (no save on every keystroke during normal typing)
- [ ] Failed auto-saves show toast notification to user
- [ ] Manual testing: type continuously for 15min, verify multiple auto-saves occurred
- [ ] Manual testing: kill app while dirty, verify recovery data exists or changes were saved

## Out of Scope

- Undo/redo for auto-saved changes (separate feature)
- Conflict resolution for external file changes (existing watcher handles this)
- Auto-save frequency configuration (keep at 2s debounce for 1.0.0)
